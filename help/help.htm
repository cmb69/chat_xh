<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.

<ol>

</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other
CMSimple_XH plugins in the website's back-end.
Select "Chat" from "Plugins".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Chat_XH in "Plugin Config".
Hints for the options will be displayed
when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done in "Plugin Language".
You can translate the character strings to your own language,
or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of the Chat_XH can be customized in "Plugin Stylesheet".</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>Embedding of a chat room on a page is done with the following plugin call:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:chat('%CHAT_ROOM%');}}}</pre>
<p>%CHAT_ROOM% can be choosen arbitrarily, but may contain only
alphanumeric character, underscores and hyphens.
You can embed as many chat rooms on any single page as you like –
they're working independent of each other as long as they have different names.</p>
<p>For automatic displaying of the latest messages
JS has to be enabled in the visitors browser.
Otherwise the chat is fully usable, but the visitor has to refresh the page manually
to see, if new messages have arrived.</p>
<p>To enable user management and to avoid spam,
it's recommended to embed chat rooms only on pages,
that are protected by register_mod_XH or memberpages_XH.
In this case the name of the currently logged in user
is stored and displayed along with the message.</p>
<p>After a configurable time of inactivity (i.e. no new messages are posted),
the chat history of the chat room will be purged automatically.</p>
<p>If you want to edit the chat data files, you can do so via FTP,
or you can configure the data folder to a folder that's accessible for filebrowsers,
e.g. userfiles/chat/, and use
<a href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Ajaxfilemanager_XH">Ajaxfilemanager_XH</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the chat data files could be accessed directly by calling their URL.
A .htaccess file to prohibit this is already contained in the default data folder.
For other servers or for custom data folders you have to take for yourself,
that those data are protected from non authorized access.</p>
